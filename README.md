### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I mostly code things for fun or to practice.
I've worked in the following programing languages:
   - C#
   - C++
   - HTML
   - CSS
   - PHP
   - Python
   - SQL
  - (And probably other but I can't remember right now)

Not much else to say at the moment.
I'll add more when I got more.
